    "Dear students, this exercise set is a bit different from the other ones. I will not provide specific exercises and instead will defer to your skills and intuitions as epidemiologists in Python. With the skills you learned in modules 1-3, you will be able to get far in the challenges below, if not complete them all. Good luck!"
